- Radio buttons work as a group. Having one radio button is insignificant. They have to be more than one.
-How to make radio buttons accessible:
   1.Corresponding radio buttons should be grouped together.
   2. Radio groups should be labeled with a name that describes the essence of the choice that’s in front of the user.

Now let’s map the factors that make the single radio button accessible:

    It has to be focusable, so that keyboard only users will be able to reach it.
    It should have a discernible focus indication to mark the position on the focus sequence for keyboard users.
    It has to programmatically express its role, so that assistive technologies can read and announce it as a radio button.
    It has to be properly labeled so that it is understandable and interactable for assistive technologies users.
    It has to express its state (checked/unchecked).
